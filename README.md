# Project Name: HR-Analytics
---
# Project Objectives:
HR analytics, also known as Human Resources analytics or HR data analytics, is a field that involves data analysis and data visualization techniques to make data-driven decisions related to human resources management.

---
# Data Sourcing:
MeriSKILL provided the dataset

---
# Tools used:
The tool used for this analysis is Python. 

I imported the following python libraries ; NumPy and Pandas which were for the main analysis and then the matplotlib and seaborn for the visualization.

# Data Transformation:
1. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: The tasks I did here include deleting redundant columns, renaming columns for easy identification, removing duplicate records, cleaning individual columns (e.g., eliminating whitespace), and handling missing values (removing Nan values).
2. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This aspect involves visualizing key metrics to gain insights and make informed decisions. These visualizations cover aspects such as employee overtime, marital status, job roles, gender distribution, education fields, department distribution, business travel, and relationships between variables like overtime and age, total working years, education level, number of companies worked, and distance from home. These insights can improve HR processes, make informed decisions about workforce management, and enhance overall organizational performance.

# Major Highlight of the Visual:
1. 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: I created similar code blocks for visualizing other categorical variables and relationships between variables. Correlation analysis is used in this project to understand the relationships between different variables in the HR dataset. It helps identify connections, select relevant features, visualize patterns, and make data-driven decisions for HR management.
2. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗻𝘀: I calculated the layout of the subplots and then iterated it through the dataset columns to create appropriate visualizations. Numerical columns are visualized using histograms, categorical columns are visualized using count plots and relationship between numerical and categorical columns using the boxplot. The results provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset’s characteristics, making it easier to understand and identify patterns or anomalies.

The project aims to explore and analyze HR-related data to gain insights into employee demographics, job satisfaction, and career growth within the company. Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques are applied to facilitate this analysis. The findings from this project could inform HR policies and strategies within the organization.
